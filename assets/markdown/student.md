    4.  No student is allowed to sit in class where they are not enrolled.

The following minimum standards shall be observed governing scholastic requirements:

1.  **Warning**
    1.  A student who in a given semester, obtains failing grades from 25 to 33 1/3 percent of the total number of academic units registered shall be warned by the Dean of Studies to improve their academic work and shall be required to report to the Guidance Counselor's Office for further guidance and counseling.
    2.  A student who has been given a warning for two consecutive semesters shall be automatically under academic probation in the next semester of their enrollment.
2.  **Academic Probation**
    1.  A student who in any given semester obtains failing grades in 33 1/3 % to 60% of the total number of academic units, shall be placed on academic probation in the next semester of enrollment.
    2.  A student placed on academic probation shall be limited in academic load during said semester. If registered in more than 15 academic units at the same time of poor academic performance, the load shall be reduced by one course in the next semester or term of enrollment.

    1.  A student who has been absent in a class for at least 15 percent but not more than 20 percent of the required total number of class or laboratory period in a semester shall be dropped from the class; however, if the absences are un excused and quizzes or examinations are given during said absence, a grade of 5.0 shall be given during the said absence; a grade of 5.0 shaII be given in the course for which the quiz or examination is missed.

        On the other hand, if a student belongs to the upper half of the class, the faculty member at his discretion may allow them to continue attending the class.

    2.  A student who has incurred absences of more than 20 percent of the prescribed number of class or laboratory periods during the semester shall be given a failing grade or no credit for the course or in accordance with the 1992 8th Edition of the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools.

# Categories of Sanctions

1.  **Suspension**

The Manual of Regulations for Private Schools 1992,

(8TH edition) provides two kinds of suspension : punitive suspension and preventive suspension.

1.  **Punitive Suspension**

Punitive suspension refers to the school's prevention of a student from attending class and thus from taking any examinations, quizzes and graded recitations given during the specified period. Since he is not excused from this graded work, he shall not be given special examination to make up for them later, as that would grant him an advantage over his more scrupulous classmates.

Punitive suspension may be imposed without first informing the CHED as long as the period involved does not exceed 20% of the precise class days or the school year. A student meted a suspension of more than 20% of his class days stands to lose the entire year or term for he may be deprived of the credits he has already earned. If the suspension period exceeds that limit the school must advise the appropriate CHED office, but only to notify them and not to seek their approval.

The 20% rule on suspension conforms to the limit on absences stipulated in Section 73 of the Manual.

Section 72 provides that a student under suspension may not enroll in another school unless his suspension has expired.

1.  **Preventive Suspension**

    Preventive suspension is not a penalty but a deterrent to the disruption of normal school operations (or a threat to lives and property) that may be caused by the continued presence of a student offender on campus. Although the Manual does not specify it, preventive suspension may also be imposed to protect the offender from acts of vindictiveness.

    A student may be immediately placed under preventive suspension during the pendency of the disciplinary proceedings against him. This must be done to maintain an atmosphere conducive to education in the school, preserve decorum in the classroom and uphold respect for administrators and teachers.

    Therefore, unlike punitive suspension, preventive suspension may be imposed without first complying with academic due process in student disciplinary cases.

    Once the student under preventive suspension is found guilty of the charges, punitive suspension may then be imposed upon him, in this event, the period previously served shaII be considered part of the penalty. However, if he is absolved of the charges, though he is not entitled to make for the days lost, he shall be allowed to take the examinations, quizzes and graded recitations he missed.

1.  **Exclusion**

    Exclusion is a penalty involving the removal of an undesirable student from the school rolls. The student is excluded during the same year or term he is found guilty of a serious breach of school rules.

    Often thought as synonymous, exclusion in fact differs from "non-read mission" because the latter allows a student to complete his course, while the former takes immediate effect and prevents the student from finishing the term, Also, although there are similar grounds for both penalties, academic deficiency and the closure of the course or school are further reasons for refusing to re-admit a student - but not excluding them.

    It must be stressed again that both penalties are invalidated by the failure to observe academic due process. Furthermore, even if the penalties are legally applied, they do not disqualify the student from, being accepted into another school, not justify the penalizing school in withholding his transfer credentials.

    Prior notice to or approval by the CHED is not required in cases of exclusions, what is needed is the school's submission of the case documents to the agency. This is done to give CHED chance to review these documents in case aggrieved students file an appeal. (Appeal may be within one year after the decision is handed down.)\\

2.  **Expulsion**

    Expulsion is an extreme administrative sanction debarring offending students from all public or private schools in the Philippines. It is the most severe penalty available to schools, and may not be imposed without the approval of the CHED. To secure such authority, the school must submit its decision on the case with supporting documentation to the CHED within 10 days from the end of the investigation. Since only the CHED can impose such a sanction, only the Commission can lift it. This is implied in Section 59 of the Manual which states:

    Section 59. Release of Records - The school records of a student under a penalty of suspension or expulsion shall not be released until the laps of the penalty – therefore, at the discretion of the school in the case of suspension or approval by the CHED in case of expulsion.

    According to the Manual, expulsion is usually considered proper punishment for the following serious offenses: gross misconduct; dishonesty, hazing, carrying a deadly weapon, immorality, selling and or possession of prohibited drugs, drug dependency, drunkenness, hooliganism, vandalism, assaulting a student or school personnel, instigating or leading illegal strikes or similar concerted activities resulting in the stoppage of classes, preventing or threatening any student or school personnel from entering the school premises or attending Classes or discharging their duties, forging or tampering school records or school forms, and securing or using forged school records, forms and documents.

3.  **Administrative Actions and Proceedings**

    The University, through any of its authorized representatives, may cause the filing of an administrative action against any student for violation of its disciplinary rules and regulations. Any administrative action filed against a student must comply with the minimum standards of due process prescribed herein as follows:

    1.  The student must be informed in writing of the nature and cause of any accusation against him, and required to answer the accusation in writing. If the student is a minor, the parent or the guardian shanll be furnished a copy of the letter.
    2.  If the student denies th accusation or alleges some fact or matter in justification or mitigation of the offense, the institution shall form a fact-finding committee to hear and receive evidence.
    3.  In all stages of the proceedings, the student shall have the right to assistance of a counsel of his own choice.
